On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves. A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net. In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light. The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green. Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone. A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine. The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.",

To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves. Carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone. A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.\nAction: Examine well\nObservation: A very small well suffering from age. It is probably meant primarily as decoration, however, for authenticity, it is also functional. This is made obvious by the crank and length of rope mounted above it.\nAction: Take pail\nObservation: Taken.\nAction: Examine pail\nObservation: The old bucket is bent and dented and rust encrusted.

You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west.

It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open.

Thank you my knight, she says. The task is finished.\nYou should perform actions to accomplish the goal: You are trying to yield weapon Yi-Lono-Mordel. However, first you need to power it up.

Your escorts come to a halt behind you. Tolan, the tall, wiry woman says to you. You steel yourself for the need to speak. Cheryl, you reply. Dig Leader Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the galaxy. Again. Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all. You turn your empty hands face-up. Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity. Control Room Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor.

The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor. Cheryl stands here, watching you closely. Cheryl says, \"This is our chance to make a difference, Tolan. But only if we do it according to my rules. You're going to see what sort of information you can get displayed. As soon as you bring some Yi text up, you stop. You don't touch anything until I say it's ok to continue. Got it?\" >\nAction: Look\nObservation:  Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room This low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor. Cheryl stands here, watching you closely. Cheryl says, \"As you asked, the guards will keep their distance so they won't disturb your concentration. It'll just be you and me. And, since I'm no mechanist, I've got this--just so I can keep tabs on you.\" She shows you a holographic reproduction of this room, hovering over a black base. \"There are sensors for movement, electromagnetic radiation, and I don't know what else, all analyzing this room. This little display lets me monitor the activity everywhere in the room so I can see what you're up to. So don't think you'll get away with anything.\" >\nAction: Examine the holographic reproduction of the room\nObservation: You can't see any such thing. >\nAction: Look\nObservation:  Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room This low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility.

If I don't have it, you're not going to get to do anything, anything at all.\" Cheryl thinks for a moment and then speaks again. \"However, I recall we confiscated a pair of electromagnetic-sensitive goggles from you back when we... found... you here.\" She speaks into her communicator. Several minutes later, one of the guards stands in the doorway and tosses the goggles on the floor next to you, then leaves. >\nAction: Take goggles\nObservation: Taken. >\nAction: Examine goggles\nObservation: You've used these goggles for so long it's impossible not to think of them as a superior part of an otherwise inferior body. Even though the translation of broadband electromagnetic emissions into your visual perceptual system is limited by that selfsame perceptual system, it's better than nothing. >\nAction: Look\nObservation:  Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room This low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor. Cheryl stands here, watching you closely. >\nAction: Examine forms\nObservation: The forms consist of a raised slab (in the same proportions as the ellipsoidal room, but a rectangular parallelepiped instead) and two gleaming swept curves (one on each side of the slab). >\nAction: Examine raised slab\nObservation: The slab, subtly off-white, is warm to the touch, and hides the sensitive Yi technological components needed to manipulate the whole of Yi-Lono-Mordel; this much you were able to determine the last time you were here. In the top center edge on the side opposite the door is a small notch. Cheryl sighs. \"Tolan, do you have any idea how important it is we figure this place out, once and for all?\" >\nAction: Push notch\nObservation: You touch the the notch with a minimal pressure. It is cooler than the rest of the slab, and you can feel the heat from your finger being drawn out momentarily. Where no cracks had been visible before, nevertheless sections of the top of the slab give way, and a control surface slides up and clicks into place. Cheryl says, \"Ok, this is interesting.\" She peers at the control surface. >\nAction: Examine control surface\nObservation: The control surface is covered with a large grid of studs arranged in a hexagonal packing; it also features a set-in viewscreen. Cheryl says, \"What's on that screen?\" She approaches from other side of the slab. \"Bah. See if you can find some text there.\" >\nAction: Look\nObservation:  Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room This low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. In the center sits a slab, two swept curves surrounding it. On the slab is a control surface. Cheryl stands here, watching you closely. >\nAction: Check valid actions\nObservation: You can take the following actions: push powerup stud, push project status stud, push sequence stud, put goggles down, put on goggles, examine forms, put goggles on slab, put goggles on studs, give pair goggles, check valid actions\nAction: Push powerup stud\nObservation: You touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. Hmm... Absolutely nothing happens. Given the years of disuse, perhaps the generator is in need of minor maintenance. You search the control surface and find a generator access stud, which should give you access to the generator so you can make any repairs necessary. >\nAction: Examine generator access stud\nObservation: Activating this stud should give you access to the fusion generator used to power this facility. >\nAction: Push generator access stud\nObservation: You touch your fingertip gently against the generator access stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it. A pale green energy appears on the monitor hologram. Cheryl says, \"What's that? Don't touch...\" To the right, a white pillar with an elliptical cross-section slides up out of the floor. Cheryl says, \"You better know what you're doing here, Tolan.\" >\nAction: Examine white pillar\nObservation: This looks to be the fusion generator. It is an elliptical white pillar, almost two meters tall, one meter wide, and half a meter deep. On the long front side is an access panel, which is closed. >\nAction: Open access panel\nObservation: The access panel has no seams you could work your fingernails into, and nothing else you could grip. >\nAction: Examine access panel\nObservation: Visible only by a small color variation, a parametrically-rectangular section of the front of the pillar seems to be an access panel. >\nAction: "

The pit stretches above and below you; but you can see no way to climb from here, either way. A gentle arc hangs across the pit, well above your head.\nAction: Examine arc\nObservation: It's a rope. Someone must have been trying to cross the pit. Yes, you can make out the side passages now -- dark patches in the walls above you. The rope seems to be tied to a pillar by one; the other end is wound around an opposite pillar, hooked precariously by something white and curved.\nAction: Take rope\nObservation: Even at the center of its arc, the rope is fifteen feet above you.\nAction: "
