I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...Court Yard - A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves. Carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone. A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

Every library should try to be complete on something, if it were only the history of pinheads. -- Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Poet at the Breakfast-Table You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester! You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class (The History of IF Games), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light.

The castle is to your north. There is a barrel in front of you. \nAction: Examine barrel\nObservation: There is a gleaming elvish sword. \nAction: take the sword\nObservation: The sword is taken\nAction: north\nObservation: Main hall \n The castle is dimly lit, with lava flowing in many places. There is a staircase leading up to princess bedroom, a door to your north leading to the kitchen hall, and the door you just entered on your south\nAction: check valid actions\nObservation: south, north, up, look, examine staircase\nAction: up\nObservation: Princess\u2019s bedroom.

Thank you my knight, she says. The task is finished.\nYou should perform actions to accomplish the goal: You are trying to yield weapon Yi-Lono-Mordel. However, first you need to power it up. You need to successfully activate the power stud, though you need to recalibrate the contacts first.\nYou should use the following commands for help when your action cannot be understood: check valid actions\nYou should use the following commands for help when your action cannot be understood: inventory\nObservation: You pass the sentry watching the doorway to the Yi control room, hardly aware of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the owner of the familiar, frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to a halt behind you. Tolan, the tall, wiry woman says to you. You steel yourself for the need to speak. Cheryl, you reply. Dig Leader Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the galaxy. Again. Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all. You turn your empty hands face-up. Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity. Control Room Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor. Cheryl Thadafel stands here, watching you closely. \nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: ]\nObservation: That's not a verb I recognise. >\nAction: "
