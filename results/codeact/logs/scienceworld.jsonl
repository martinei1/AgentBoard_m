The objects you can use are a metal pot, a thermometer, a fridge, cups, and a stove in the kitchen. You should pick up a thermometer for temperature measurement. Take actions that will cause it to change its state of matter.  You need to increase the apple juice's temperature and monitor the temperature until its is changed. Once th juice boiled, examine the changed state of apple juice. For compounds without a boiling point, combusting the substance is also acceptable.",

You should monitor the temperature and examine the substance during the freezing process. Once you transform liquid unknown substance J into solid state, you should use thermometer to measure its the temperature. If the melting point of liquid unknown substance J is above 200.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow box. If the melting point of liquid unknown substance J is below 200.0 degrees celsius, focus on the purple box.
