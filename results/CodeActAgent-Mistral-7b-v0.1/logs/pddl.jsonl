Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying.

  "example_prompt": "You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms. Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room.

The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying.

  "example_prompt": "You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms. Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed.\n    There are 13 actions defined in this domain:\n    open <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is unlocked and closed. The effect of this action is that the container is open and not closed.\n    close <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is open. The effect of this action is that the container is closed and not open.\n    fetch <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is inside the container and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is held by the agent and not inside the container.\n    put-away <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is held by the agent and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is inside the container and not held by the agent.\n    loosen <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is tight, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is loose and not tight.\n    tighten <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is loose, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is tight and not loose.\n    jack-up <hub>: This action represents the process of lifting a hub off the ground using a jack. It requires the agent to have a jack and for the hub to be on the ground. After performing this action, the hub will no longer be on the ground and the agent will no longer have the jack.\n    jack-down <hub>: This action represents the process of lowering a hub back to the ground from an elevated position using a jack. It requires the agent to have the hub off the ground. After performing this action, the hub will be back on the ground and the agent will have the jack.\n    undo <nut> <hub>: This action undo the fastening of a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up), the hub is fastened, the agent has a wrench and the nut is loose. The effects are the agent has the nut, the hub is unfastened, the hub is no longer loose and the hub is not fastened anymore.\n    do-up <nut> <hub>: This action fasten a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the agent has a wrench, the hub is unfastened, the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up) and the agent has the nut to be fastened. The effects are the nut is now loose on the hub, the hub is fastened, the hub is no longer unfastened and the agent no longer has the nut.\n    remove-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action removes a wheel from a hub. It can only be performed if the hub is not on the ground, the wheel is currently on the hub, and the hub is unfastened. After the action is performed, the agent will have the removed wheel and the hub will be free, meaning that the wheel is no longer on the hub.\n    put-on-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action puts a wheel onto a hub. It can only be performed if the agent has the wheel, the hub is free, the hub is unfastened, and the hub is not on the ground. After the action is performed, the wheel will be on the hub, the hub will no longer be free, and the agent will no longer have the wheel.\n    inflate <wheel>: This action inflates a wheel using a pump.

  "example_prompt": "Your goal is to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs. Remember to open boot first to get tools you need. Intact tyres should be inflated. The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed.\n    There are 13 actions defined in this domain:\n    open <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is unlocked and closed. The effect of this action is that the container is open and not closed.\n    close <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is open. The effect of this action is that the container is closed and not open.\n    fetch <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is inside the container and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is held by the agent and not inside the container.\n    put-away <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is held by the agent and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is inside the container and not held by the agent.\n    loosen <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is tight, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is loose and not tight.\n    tighten <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is loose, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is tight and not loose.\n    jack-up <hub>: This action represents the process of lifting a hub off the ground using a jack. It requires the agent to have a jack and for the hub to be on the ground. After performing this action, the hub will no longer be on the ground and the agent will no longer have the jack.\n    jack-down <hub>: This action represents the process of lowering a hub back to the ground from an elevated position using a jack. It requires the agent to have the hub off the ground. After performing this action, the hub will be back on the ground and the agent will have the jack.\n    undo <nut> <hub>: This action undo the fastening of a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up), the hub is fastened, the agent has a wrench and the nut is loose. The effects are the agent has the nut, the hub is unfastened, the hub is no longer loose and the hub is not fastened anymore.\n    do-up <nut> <hub>: This action fasten a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the agent has a wrench, the hub is unfastened, the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up) and the agent has the nut to be fastened. The effects are the nut is now loose on the hub, the hub is fastened, the hub is no longer unfastened and the agent no longer has the nut.\n    remove-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action removes a wheel from a hub. It can only be performed if the hub is not on the ground, the wheel is currently on the hub, and the hub is unfastened. After the action is performed, the agent will have the removed wheel and the hub will be free, meaning that the wheel is no longer on the hub.\n    put-on-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action puts a wheel onto a hub. It can only be performed if the agent has the wheel, the hub is free, the hub is unfastened, and the hub is not on the ground. After the action is performed, the wheel will be on the hub, the hub will no longer be free, and the agent will no longer have the wheel.\n    inflate <wheel>: This action inflates a wheel using a pump. It can only be performed if the agent has a pump, the wheel is not inflated, and the wheel is intact. After the action is performed, the wheel will be inflated.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: w1 is in boot. (Note you need to open boot first so that you can extract tools from it.)\nObservation: Boot is closed. Boot is unlocked. Hub the-hub1 is fastened. Hub the-hub1 is on the ground. Jack is in boot.

  "example_prompt": "Your goal is to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs. Remember to open boot first to get tools you need. Intact tyres should be inflated. The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed.\n    There are 13 actions defined in this domain:\n    open <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is unlocked and closed. The effect of this action is that the container is open and not closed.\n    close <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is open. The effect of this action is that the container is closed and not open.\n    fetch <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is inside the container and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is held by the agent and not inside the container.\n    put-away <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is held by the agent and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is inside the container and not held by the agent.\n    loosen <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is tight, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is loose and not tight.\n    tighten <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is loose, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is tight and not loose.\n    jack-up <hub>: This action represents the process of lifting a hub off the ground using a jack. It requires the agent to have a jack and for the hub to be on the ground. After performing this action, the hub will no longer be on the ground and the agent will no longer have the jack.\n    jack-down <hub>: This action represents the process of lowering a hub back to the ground from an elevated position using a jack. It requires the agent to have the hub off the ground. After performing this action, the hub will be back on the ground and the agent will have the jack.\n    undo <nut> <hub>: This action undo the fastening of a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up), the hub is fastened, the agent has a wrench and the nut is loose. The effects are the agent has the nut, the hub is unfastened, the hub is no longer loose and the hub is not fastened anymore.\n    do-up <nut> <hub>: This action fasten a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the agent has a wrench, the hub is unfastened, the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up) and the agent has the nut to be fastened. The effects are the nut is now loose on the hub, the hub is fastened, the hub is no longer unfastened and the agent no longer has the nut.\n    remove-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action removes a wheel from a hub. It can only be performed if the hub is not on the ground, the wheel is currently on the hub, and the hub is unfastened. After the action is performed, the agent will have the removed wheel and the hub will be free, meaning that the wheel is no longer on the hub.\n    put-on-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action puts a wheel onto a hub. It can only be performed if the agent has the wheel, the hub is free, the hub is unfastened, and the hub is not on the ground. After the action is performed, the wheel will be on the hub, the hub will no longer be free, and the agent will no longer have the wheel.\n    inflate <wheel>: This action inflates a wheel using a pump. It can only be performed if the agent has a pump, the wheel is not inflated, and the wheel is intact. After the action is performed, the wheel will be inflated.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: w1 is in boot. (Note you need to open boot first so that you can extract tools from it.)\nObservation: Boot is closed. Boot is unlocked. Hub the-hub1 is fastened. Hub the-hub1 is on the ground. Jack is in boot.

  "example_prompt": "Your goal is to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs. Remember to open boot first to get tools you need. Intact tyres should be inflated. The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed.\n    There are 13 actions defined in this domain:\n    open <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is unlocked and closed. The effect of this action is that the container is open and not closed.\n    close <container>: The precondition for this action is that the container is open. The effect of this action is that the container is closed and not open.\n    fetch <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is inside the container and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is held by the agent and not inside the container.\n    put-away <object> <container>: The precondition for this action is that the object is held by the agent and the container is open. The effect of this action is that the object is inside the container and not held by the agent.\n    loosen <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is tight, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is loose and not tight.\n    tighten <nut> <hub>: The precondition for this action is that the agent has a wrench, the nut on hub is loose, and the hub is on the ground. The effect of this action is that the nut on hub is tight and not loose.\n    jack-up <hub>: This action represents the process of lifting a hub off the ground using a jack. It requires the agent to have a jack and for the hub to be on the ground. After performing this action, the hub will no longer be on the ground and the agent will no longer have the jack.\n    jack-down <hub>: This action represents the process of lowering a hub back to the ground from an elevated position using a jack. It requires the agent to have the hub off the ground. After performing this action, the hub will be back on the ground and the agent will have the jack.\n    undo <nut> <hub>: This action undo the fastening of a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up), the hub is fastened, the agent has a wrench and the nut is loose. The effects are the agent has the nut, the hub is unfastened, the hub is no longer loose and the hub is not fastened anymore.\n    do-up <nut> <hub>: This action fasten a nut on a hub. The preconditions are the agent has a wrench, the hub is unfastened, the hub is not on the ground (i.e., it has been jacked up) and the agent has the nut to be fastened. The effects are the nut is now loose on the hub, the hub is fastened, the hub is no longer unfastened and the agent no longer has the nut.\n    remove-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action removes a wheel from a hub. It can only be performed if the hub is not on the ground, the wheel is currently on the hub, and the hub is unfastened. After the action is performed, the agent will have the removed wheel and the hub will be free, meaning that the wheel is no longer on the hub.\n    put-on-wheel <wheel> <hub>: This action puts a wheel onto a hub. It can only be performed if the agent has the wheel, the hub is free, the hub is unfastened, and the hub is not on the ground. After the action is performed, the wheel will be on the hub, the hub will no longer be free, and the agent will no longer have the wheel.\n    inflate <wheel>: This action inflates a wheel using a pump. It can only be performed if the agent has a pump, the wheel is not inflated, and the wheel is intact. After the action is performed, the wheel will be inflated.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: w1 is in boot. (Note you need to open boot first so that you can extract tools from it.)\nObservation: Boot is closed. Boot is unlocked. Hub the-hub1 is fastened. Hub the-hub1 is on the ground. Jack is in boot.
